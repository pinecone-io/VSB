"""
Sometimes during tests, the Locust process hangs/times out and is unable to clean up the index it creates in Pinecone.
This can interfere with subsequent tests by leaving pod indices in the DaveR-VSB-CI project, not to mention keeping
the project cluttered with unnecessary indices. This script is intended to be run after each test to clean up any
remaining indices in the project.
